# Assignment 2

The following deliverables were required as stated in the notebook:
1. The best model checkpoint you trained in the Section 1.2 "Start Training and Validation!": These are present in the `models` directory under the folders `lr2e-05-warmup0.3` and `lr5e-05-warmup0.3`
2. The best model prediction results in the Section 1.2 "Fine-Grained Validation": These are present in the `predictions` directory
3. Your annotated test dataset in the Section 3.2 "Annotate Your 100 Datapoints with Partner(s)": These are present as `03-366788.jsonl` file. The file used for testing the model is `03-final.jsonl` which uses my labels as the ground truth labels.
4. Your augmented training data and best model checkpoint in the Section 4.2 "Augment Your Model": The augmented dataset is present in `nli_data` directory. For more information on what the files represent, please refer to the last section of the notebook. The augmented models are present in `models` directory under `models/task4-augmented` and `models/task4-original-train`. More details on these can be found in `models/readme.txt`.


Note: I cannot see my notebook on Github, it is giving some weird error which I am unable to fix. But I am able to view it in my local editor (VS Code). Since I trained on colab, maybe that is causing some version issues with Github. I am attaching a link to my notebook on Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1374E7XkKOIP5lbpgsQNXVJGr-zold6D5?usp=sharing

In case my notebook is not viewable from your end on Github or locally, please refer to the link above to view my notebook. Thank you for your consideration.
